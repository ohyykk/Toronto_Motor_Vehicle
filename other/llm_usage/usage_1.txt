for this model, ## Model Set-Up

### Theft Risk Sub-Indexes

To capture theft risk without relying on logistic regression due to the absence of negative (non-theft) cases, we calculated sub-indexes for three critical factors:

-Hour of the Day: Risk distribution across 24 hours, normalized so the sum equals 1/3.

-Day of the Week: Risk distribution across 7 days, normalized so the sum equals 1/3.

-Premises Type: Risk distribution across premises types (House, Outside, Commercial), normalized so the sum equals 1/3.

The total theft component is calculated as: \begin{align*}
C_{\text{Theft}} &= \text{Hour Index} + \text{Day Index} + \text{Premises Type Index}
\end{align*}

This approach ensures proportional representation of each factor while accounting for varying risks based on time and location characteristics.

### Collision Probability Model

A logistic regression model was used to predict the likelihood of severe collisions P(Collision) based on several predictors. The log-odds of the collision probability are modeled as:  

{=tex}
\begin{align*}
\log\left(\frac{P(\text{Collision})}{1 - P(\text{Collision})}\right) &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{HOOD}_{158} + \beta_2 \cdot \text{Road Surface Condition} + \beta_3 \cdot \text{Lighting Condition} \\
&\quad + \beta_4 \cdot \text{Traffic Control} + \beta_5 \cdot \text{Road Visibility} + \beta_6 \cdot \text{Time of Day} + \epsilon
\end{align*}

The model prediction utilizes the following predictor variables:

-   Neighborhood ID (hood_158): Unique identifier for the neighborhood.
-   Road Surface Condition (road_conditions): Conditions such as dry, wet, or icy.
-   Lighting Condition (lighting_conditions): Visibility levels, such as daylight or artificial light.
-   Traffic Control (traffic_control): Presence of traffic management devices (e.g., stop signs, signals).
-   Road Visibility (visibility_conditions): Road visibility conditions, such as clear, snow or rain
-   Time of Day (time): Time where collision occured in Toronto

The model assigns coefficients as follows:

{=tex}
\begin{align*}
\beta_i \text{ to each variable, enabling the calculation of collision probability }\\ 
P(\text{Collision})\text{ under specific environmental and situational conditions.} 
\end{align*}

### Risk Index Calculation

The final Risk Index integrates the collision probability P(Collision) and theft component T using weighted aggregation:

{=tex}
\begin{align*}
\text{Risk Index} = w_1\cdot P(\text{Collision}) + w_2\cdot T
\end{align*}

Weights are defined as: \begin{align*}
w_1 = 0.7, \quad w_2 = 0.3
\end{align*} These reflect the relative importance of collision and theft risks, emphasizing collision severity due to its greater immediate impact. for these predictor variables: ## Predictor Variables

Error: Functions that produce HTML output found in document targeting pdf output.
Please change the output type of this document to HTML.
If you're aiming to have some HTML widgets shown in non-HTML format as a screenshot,
please install webshot or webshot2 R package for knitr to do the screenshot, and configure it by looking at its documentation.
Alternatively, you can allow HTML output in non-HTML formats
by adding this option to the YAML front-matter of
your quarto file:

  prefer-html: true

Note however that the HTML output will not be visible in non-HTML formats.

Execution halted
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The error indicates that your Quarto (.qmd) document is trying to generate HTML output (e.g., widgets or diagrams) while the target output format is PDF. Quarto does not allow HTML content in PDF output unless explicitly configured.

Here’s how to resolve this issue:

Solution 1: Switch Output Format to HTML
If you want HTML features (e.g., widgets, interactive content), switch the output format in your YAML front matter:

yaml
Copy code
---
title: "Your Title"
output: html
---
Solution 2: Enable HTML Output in Non-HTML Formats
If you want to include HTML features in a non-HTML output (like PDF), add the prefer-html: true option in the YAML front matter:

yaml
Copy code
---
title: "Your Title"
output: pdf
prefer-html: true
---
Note: The HTML content will not be rendered in the PDF but will still be included.

Solution 3: Convert HTML Widgets to Screenshots
If you want HTML widgets to appear as static images in the PDF, install the webshot2 R package and configure it:

Install webshot2:

r
Copy code
install.packages("webshot2")
Update your .qmd document to ensure widgets are converted to static images.

Solution 4: Remove or Replace HTML Widgets
Identify and remove code producing HTML output or replace it with alternatives compatible with PDF. For example:

If you're using DiagrammeR for diagrams, replace it with static diagrams using DiagrammeRsvg and rsvg:

r
Copy code
library(DiagrammeR)
library(DiagrammeRsvg)
library(rsvg)

grViz("
  digraph G {
    A -> B;
  }
") %>%
  export_svg() %>%
  charToRaw() %>%
  rsvg_pdf("diagram.pdf")
Then, include the saved diagram.pdf in your document.

Steps to Debug
Identify the HTML-generating code in your .qmd file.
Decide which solution fits your goal (e.g., switch format, convert to static content).
Adjust the YAML front matter or specific code blocks accordingly.
Let me know if you'd like further guidance!





You said:
you cant use this library for drawing tree diagrams: library(DiagrammeR)
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If you cannot use DiagrammeR for drawing tree diagrams, you can use other libraries like ggplot2 for a custom visualization or igraph for creating a tree structure. Here's an example using ggplot2 and ggraph for a tree diagram:

Code Example with ggplot2 and ggraph
r
Copy code
# Load required libraries
library(tidygraph)
library(ggraph)

# Define the tree structure as a dataframe
tree_data <- data.frame(
  from = c("Risk Index", "Risk Index", "Theft Index", "Theft Index", "Theft Index",
           "Collision Probability", "Collision Probability", "Collision Probability", 
           "Collision Probability", "Collision Probability", "Collision Probability"),
  to = c("Theft Index", "Collision Probability", "Hour of the Day", "Day of the Week", 
         "Premises Type", "Neighborhood ID", "Road Surface Condition", 
         "Lighting Condition", "Traffic Control", "Time of Day", "Road Visibility")
)

# Convert to graph object
tree_graph <- as_tbl_graph(tree_data)

# Plot the tree diagram
ggraph(tree_graph, layout = "tree") +
  geom_edge_link() +
  geom_node_point(size = 5, color = "lightblue") +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name), vjust = -0.5, size = 5) +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("Tree Diagram of Predictor Variables")
Explanation:
Tree Structure: tree_data defines the parent-child relationships.
ggraph Layout: The layout = "tree" ensures a hierarchical tree structure.
Styling: Nodes are styled with geom_node_point, and text labels are added with geom_node_text.
This approach works with commonly available R packages and avoids using DiagrammeR. Let me know if you need further customization!





You said:
 download.packages(tidygraph)
Error in download.packages(tidygraph) : 
  argument "destdir" is missing, with no default
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The error occurs because the download.packages() function requires a destdir argument to specify where the package files will be saved, and it is being used incorrectly for package installation. To install the tidygraph package, you should use install.packages() instead:

r
Copy code
install.packages("tidygraph")
If you also need ggraph:

r
Copy code
install.packages("ggraph")
Explanation
install.packages() is the correct function to install R packages directly from CRAN.
download.packages() is used to download the package files without installing them, which is why it requires a destdir.
Additional Notes
Make sure you have an active internet connection and the required permissions to install packages. If there are any other issues, let me know!

         "Premises Type", "Neighborhood ID", "Road Surface Condition", 
         "Lighting Condition", "Traffic Control", "Time of Day", "Road Visibility")
)

# Convert to graph object
tree_graph <- as_tbl_graph(tree_data)

# Plot the improved tree diagram
ggraph(tree_graph, layout = "dendrogram", circular = FALSE) +
  geom_edge_link(color = "gray", arrow = arrow(length = unit(4, "mm")), end_cap = circle(4, "mm")) +
  geom_node_point(size = 6, color = "steelblue") +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name), hjust = -0.1, size = 4, color = "black") +

    axis.text = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    panel.grid = element_blank()
  ) +
  ggtitle("Enhanced Tree Diagram of Predictor Variables")
Improvements in This Version
Hierarchical Layout: The dendrogram layout provides a clear hierarchy.
Color Coding: Nodes are colored steelblue for better visibility.
Text Alignment: Node labels are positioned to avoid overlap.
Edges with Arrows: Edges now have arrows to indicate direction.
Aesthetic Theme: Removed unnecessary gridlines and axis labels.

You said:
can you make it sidewards, also can you make the line curve
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Here’s how to modify the tree diagram to make it horizontal (sidewards) with curved edges for a cleaner look:

Updated Code: Horizontal Layout with Curved Lines
r
Copy code
# Load required libraries
library(tidygraph)
library(ggraph)

# Define the tree structure as a dataframe
tree_data <- data.frame(
  from = c("Risk Index", "Risk Index", "Theft Index", "Theft Index", "Theft Index",

         "Premises Type", "Neighborhood ID", "Road Surface Condition", 
         "Lighting Condition", "Traffic Control", "Time of Day", "Road Visibility")
)

# Convert to graph object
tree_graph <- as_tbl_graph(tree_data)

# Plot the tree diagram with horizontal layout and curved lines
ggraph(tree_graph, layout = "dendrogram", circular = FALSE) +
  geom_edge_bend(color = "gray", curvature = 0.5, arrow = arrow(length = unit(4, "mm")), end_cap = circle(4, "mm")) +
  geom_node_point(size = 6, color = "steelblue") +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name), hjust = 0, size = 4, color = "black", angle = 0) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold"),
    axis.title = element_blank(),
    axis.text = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    panel.grid = element_blank()
  ) +
  ggtitle("Horizontal Tree Diagram of Predictor Variables") +
  coord_flip()
Key Adjustments
Horizontal Layout: Added coord_flip() to rotate the tree to a sidewards orientation.
Curved Lines: Used geom_edge_bend() with curvature = 0.5 to create curved edges for a smoother flow.
Node and Label Alignment: Adjusted hjust and angle for better text placement in the horizontal layout.
Arrow Styling: Added arrows to edges for direction clarity.
Output Expectations
The diagram will be oriented horizontally.
Edges will have a subtle curve.
Nodes and text labels will be well-aligned for readability.
Let me know if you'd like additional refinements or enhancements!





You said:

the word is a bit unclear
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To make the text clearer in the tree diagram, we can increase the text size and adjust the spacing between nodes to reduce overlap. Here's the improved version of the code:

Improved Code for Clearer Text and Better Spacing
r
Copy code
# Load required libraries
library(tidygraph)
library(ggraph)

# Define the tree structure as a dataframe
tree_data <- data.frame(
  from = c("Risk Index", "Risk Index", "Theft Index", "Theft Index", "Theft Index",

         "Premises Type", "Neighborhood ID", "Road Surface Condition", 
         "Lighting Condition", "Traffic Control", "Time of Day", "Road Visibility")
)

# Convert to graph object
tree_graph <- as_tbl_graph(tree_data)

# Plot the tree diagram with larger text and better spacing
ggraph(tree_graph, layout = "dendrogram", circular = FALSE) +
  geom_edge_bend(color = "gray", curvature = 0.6, arrow = arrow(length = unit(4, "mm")), end_cap = circle(4, "mm")) +
  geom_node_point(size = 8, color = "steelblue") +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name), hjust = -0.2, size = 5, color = "black", angle = 0) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = "bold"),
    axis.title = element_blank(),
    axis.text = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    panel.grid = element_blank()
  ) +
  ggtitle("Horizontal Tree Diagram of Predictor Variables") +
  coord_flip()
Enhancements
Increased Font Size: The size = 5 for geom_node_text makes the labels more readable.
Better Spacing: Adjusted hjust to position the labels away from nodes, reducing overlap.
Improved Node Visibility: Increased node size to size = 8.
Curvature: Increased the curve in the lines (curvature = 0.6) for a smoother and clearer layout.
Expected Improvements
Larger and clearer labels for better readability.
More spacing between nodes and text to reduce clutter.
Enhanced visual hierarchy with larger nodes and more curved lines.
Let me know if further tweaks are needed!





You said:
no imean, dont change the font size, you can change the position?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To adjust the positions of the text labels without changing the font size, we can modify the hjust (horizontal justification) and vjust (vertical justification) parameters in geom_node_text. Here's the updated code:

Adjusted Code for Better Text Positioning
r
Copy code
# Load required libraries

library(ggraph)

# Define the tree structure as a dataframe
tree_data <- data.frame(
  from = c("Risk Index", "Risk Index", "Theft Index", "Theft Index", "Theft Index",

           "Collision Probability", "Collision Probability", "Collision Probability"),
  to = c("Theft Index", "Collision Probability", "Hour of the Day", "Day of the Week", 
         "Premises Type", "Neighborhood ID", "Road Surface Condition", 
         "Lighting Condition", "Traffic Control", "Time of Day", "Road Visibility")
)

# Convert to graph object
tree_graph <- as_tbl_graph(tree_data)

# Plot the tree diagram with adjusted text positioning
ggraph(tree_graph, layout = "dendrogram", circular = FALSE) +
  geom_edge_bend(color = "gray", curvature = 0.6, arrow = arrow(length = unit(4, "mm")), end_cap = circle(4, "mm")) +
  geom_node_point(size = 6, color = "steelblue") +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name), hjust = 1.1, vjust = 0.5, size = 4, color = "black", angle = 0) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold"),
    axis.title = element_blank(),
    axis.text = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    panel.grid = element_blank()
  ) +
  ggtitle("Horizontal Tree Diagram of Predictor Variables") +
  coord_flip()
Adjustments Made
Horizontal Alignment (hjust): Adjusted to 1.1 to move the labels slightly to the left of the nodes, creating more separation between nodes and labels.
Vertical Alignment (vjust): Kept at 0.5 for vertically centered labels.
Curvature (curvature = 0.6): Maintained curved edges for smooth connections.
Output Improvements
Text labels are now positioned closer to the edges of the diagram but do not overlap with the nodes or edges.
This layout maintains the original font size and readability while improving clarity by repositioning the text.
Let me know if this works for you or needs further tweaks!





You said:

    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    panel.grid = element_blank()
  ) +
  ggtitle("Horizontal Tree Diagram of Predictor Variables") +
  coord_flip()
Key Adjustments
geom_edge_text: Added to place labels on or above the lines (edges) instead of near the nodes.
vjust = -0.5: Moves the labels slightly above the lines.
hjust = 0.5: Centers the labels horizontally on each line.
Removed geom_node_text: Labels are now directly tied to the edges.
Curvature Maintained: Edges are curved for better visual flow.
Expected Improvements
Labels will now appear directly above each edge, describing the relationship between nodes.
The layout will be horizontally oriented with curved edges for readability.
Let me know how this looks or if you need further refinements!

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The warnings and errors occur because the geom_edge_bend function doesn't have a curvature parameter, and geom_edge_text is not a function. Instead, we can use geom_edge_label to place labels along edges.

Here's the corrected code:

    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    panel.grid = element_blank()
  ) +
  ggtitle("Horizontal Tree Diagram of Predictor Variables") +
  coord_flip()
Key Fixes:
geom_edge_link: Correctly used for edges with the label aesthetic.
geom_edge_label: Used to add text directly to edges, positioned with vjust for labels above the lines.
angle_calc = 'along': Ensures the text follows the edge direction smoothly.
Output Improvements:
Labels will now appear above the edges.
Nodes retain their names, and labels are aligned correctly along the connections.
This setup ensures compatibility and proper display. Let me know if any other refinements are needed!

Explanation of Changes:
geom_edge_link: Adds the edges (lines) between nodes.
geom_text: Used to add labels to edges. The labels are extracted from the tree_data directly.
vjust = -1: Positions the labels above the edges.
Maintains coord_flip(): Keeps the tree diagram horizontal.
Output:
Labels will now appear directly above each edge.
The tree diagram will be horizontal with clear and readable labels.

The issue arises because ggraph automatically handles scales based on the graph structure, and the geom_text function expects coordinates in a numerical format, not categorical node names. Since we want to label edges above the lines, we must work with edge data directly within the ggraph framework. Here's the corrected approach:

Corrected Code

# Load required libraries
library(tidygraph)
library(ggraph)

# Define the tree structure as a dataframe
tree_data <- data.frame(
  from = c("Risk Index", "Risk Index", "Theft Index", "Theft Index", "Theft Index",
           "Collision Probability", "Collision Probability", "Collision Probability", 
           "Collision Probability", "Collision Probability", "Collision Probability"),
  to = c("Theft Index", "Collision Probability", "Hour of the Day", "Day of the Week", 
         "Premises Type", "Neighborhood ID", "Road Surface Condition",

    panel.grid = element_blank()
  ) +
  ggtitle("Horizontal Tree Diagram of Predictor Variables") +
  coord_flip()
Key Changes:
geom_edge_label: Used to label edges directly. This function is compatible with edge data in ggraph.
Node Labels and Edge Labels: Combined geom_node_text for nodes and geom_edge_label for edges.
vjust Adjustment: Adjusted vjust for edge labels to ensure they appear above the edges.
Output:
This should create a horizontal tree diagram with:

Labels above each edge (representing relationships between nodes).
Node labels positioned appropriately without overlap.

It seems like geom_edge_label is not part of the installed version of ggraph. Instead, we can use a workaround to manually extract edge midpoints and label them using geom_text for edge labels.

Here’s how to fix this issue:

Used geom_text to place the labels at the calculated midpoints.
Compatibility with ggraph:
Avoided geom_edge_label, which is unavailable in some versions of ggraph.
Coordination with coord_flip():
Ensured horizontal layout by flipping coordinates.
Output:
This method ensures:

Labels for edges appear directly above their corresponding lines.
Node and edge positions are preserved within a clean, horizontal layout.

The error occurs because x and y coordinates are not automatically included in the edge data from as_tbl_graph. Since we are using a dendrogram layout, these coordinates are managed by ggraph. To resolve this, we can extract edge and node positions directly from the layout object produced by ggraph.

The issue here is that the from and to columns don't exist in the node layout. Instead, these columns are part of the edge data in the graph. We need to extract the edge data directly from the graph object and then join it with the layout data to determine the positions for edge labels.

Joined with the layout data to map node positions (x, y) for both ends of each edge.
Calculate Edge Midpoints:
Used mutate to calculate the midpoints for the edge labels.
Correctly Plot Edges:
Used geom_edge_link to plot edges.
Add Edge Labels with geom_text:
Placed edge labels at calculated midpoints.
Output:
This code will generate a clean horizontal tree diagram with:

Nodes labeled appropriately.
Edge labels positioned correctly above the edges.

The issue with the missing "Index" in "Risk Index" likely stems from the layout squeezing or clipping the text.

write an overview of the predicted variables like this: The predictor variables in this study—month, old_price, and vendor—each contribute to explaining variations in current_price and provide a structured view of the factors influencing beef pricing across retail settings. These variables reflect temporal trends, the influence of historical pricing, and differences in vendor strategies, collectively aiding in the understanding of product pricing in the Canadian grocery market.

The month variable represents the temporal aspect of pricing, enabling the analysis of seasonal patterns in beef prices. Treating month as a categorical variable allows for the identification of months with higher or lower prices, potentially tied to changes in demand due to holidays, promotions, or seasonal supply fluctuations. For instance, months associated with holidays like Thanksgiving or cultural festivals may show increased demand, which could lead to price adjustments. This temporal perspective helps to assess whether vendors apply seasonal pricing strategies that influence current_price over time.

The predictor variables in this study—Collision Probability and Theft Index—each contribute to understanding and quantifying risk across various contexts, providing a structured framework for analyzing potential threats in urban settings. These variables reflect situational, environmental, and temporal dimensions, collectively supporting a comprehensive evaluation of risk factors.

Collision Probability
The Collision Probability variable encapsulates situational and environmental elements affecting the likelihood of severe collisions. It includes six sub-predictors:

Road Visibility: Evaluates the clarity of road conditions, such as whether visibility is obstructed by fog, rain, or other factors.
Time of Day: Considers the temporal influence of traffic patterns and lighting on collision risks during different hours.
Traffic Control: Accounts for the presence and type of traffic management devices, such as stop signs or traffic lights, influencing accident probabilities.
Lighting Condition: Represents visibility due to natural (daylight) or artificial (streetlights) lighting during the time of an incident.
Road Surface Condition: Captures surface states like wet, dry, or icy, which significantly impact vehicular control.
Neighborhood ID: Links geographical and socio-economic characteristics of specific neighborhoods to the likelihood of collisions.
These sub-predictors provide detailed insights into how environmental and temporal factors collectively shape collision risk, aiding in targeted interventions for safer traffic management.

Theft Index
The Theft Index reflects the temporal and locational vulnerability to theft, summarized through three sub-predictors:

Hour of the Day: Identifies high-risk hours for theft incidents, facilitating time-specific security measures.
Day of the Week: Captures patterns tied to weekdays versus weekends, reflecting behavioral or operational variations.
Premises Type: Differentiates theft likelihood across various locations, such as residential, commercial, or outdoor settings.
These sub-predictors provide an aggregated view of theft risk, enabling resource allocation and policy adjustments to mitigate vulnerabilities effectively.

Combined Risk Index
The integration of these variables into a unified Risk Index enables the weighted aggregation of collision and theft probabilities. This approach provides a holistic perspective on urban safety, guiding evidence-based decision-making for policymakers and urban planners.

 why did this plot occupied the whole page when i render
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The plot occupies the entire page because of how the figure's size and layout are being handled. Here are a few possible reasons and solutions to fix the issue:

Potential Issues
Figure Dimensions (Width and Height): The current fig-width and fig-height might not fit well within the page layout, causing it to stretch.
Spacing or Margins in Rendering: When rendering, Quarto may allocate extra space around the figure, causing it to occupy the entire page.
Coordination with Document Layout: If the rendering environment (e.g., PDF) does not scale the figure to fit the text area, it could stretch across the page.
Aspect Ratio: The coord_flip() function alters the orientation, which could exaggerate the plot's horizontal width.
Solutions
Adjust Figure Dimensions Modify the fig-width and fig-height to more appropriate values for the layout:

yaml
Copy code
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-height: 4
These smaller dimensions should prevent the plot from overwhelming the page.

Use out.width for PDFs or Documents For PDF output, control the width by setting out.width:

yaml
Copy code
#| out.width: "70%" # Shrinks the figure to 70% of the text width
Experiment Without coord_flip() If coord_flip() is not critical, removing it can help maintain a standard figure orientation. Alternatively, consider adjusting the aspect ratio with:

r
Copy code
ggraph(tree_graph, layout = "dendrogram", circular = FALSE) +
coord_cartesian(expand = FALSE)
Check Margins in Your Document Style Ensure the document's global styles (e.g., YAML front matter or CSS) do not enforce excessive margins for figures.

Final Adjusted Code
Here’s the updated code snippet to limit the figure's size:

r
Copy code
#| label: fig-tree
#| fig-cap: "Hierarchical relationship between risk factors contributing to theft and collision probabilities."
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-height: 4
#| out.width: "70%"

# Load required libraries
library(tidygraph)
library(ggraph)

# Define the tree structure as a dataframe
tree_data <- data.frame(
  from = c("Risk Index", "Risk Index", "Theft Index", "Theft Index", "Theft Index",
           "Collision Probability", "Collision Probability", "Collision Probability", 
           "Collision Probability", "Collision Probability", "Collision Probability"),
  to = c("Theft Index", "Collision Probability", "Hour of the Day", "Day of the Week", 
         "Premises Type", "Neighborhood ID", "Road Surface Condition", 
         "Lighting Condition", "Traffic Control", "Time of Day", "Road Visibility")
)

# Convert to graph object
tree_graph <- as_tbl_graph(tree_data)

# Plot the tree diagram with horizontal layout and curved lines
ggraph(tree_graph, layout = "dendrogram", circular = FALSE) +
  geom_edge_bend(color = "gray", curvature = 0.5, arrow = arrow(length = unit(4, "mm")), end_cap = circle(4, "mm")) +
  geom_node_point(size = 6, color = "grey") +
  geom_node_text(
    aes(label = name, hjust = ifelse(name == "Risk Index", 1.3, -0.2)), # Conditional hjust
    vjust = -0.5, size = 4, color = "black", angle = 0
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold"),
    axis.title = element_blank(),
    axis.text = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    panel.grid = element_blank()
  ) +
  coord_flip()
This should resolve the layout issues and ensure the figure doesn't occupy the entire page.

how to you fix the position of a plot 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To fix the position of a plot in a rendered document (e.g., PDF, HTML, or Word), you can control its alignment, size, and placement using Quarto/YAML options, Markdown, or even custom CSS styles. Below are different ways to address plot positioning issues effectively.

1. Center Align the Plot
To center-align your plot in the document, you can use the fig-align option in Quarto or R Markdown:

yaml
Copy code
#| fig-align: center
For example:

r
Copy code
#| label: fig-tree
#| fig-cap: "Hierarchical relationship between risk factors contributing to theft and collision probabilities."
#| fig-align: center
This will center the figure horizontally on the page.

2. Adjust the Plot's Width and Height
Use fig-width and fig-height to control the plot dimensions, ensuring it fits within the page's layout:

yaml
Copy code
#| fig-width: 6   # Control width
#| fig-height: 4  # Control height
3. Control Plot Width with out.width
For more flexible control (especially in PDFs), use out.width to specify how wide the figure should be relative to the text width:

yaml
Copy code
#| out.width: "80%"  # Makes the plot 80% of the text width
You can combine this with fig-align: center to center the plot while constraining its size.

4. Add Padding or Margins
If you want to add some space around the plot (e.g., to prevent it from overlapping text), you can use LaTeX, CSS, or Quarto's margin options.

LaTeX (for PDFs):
Use \vspace or \hspace around your plot in a LaTeX environment:

latex
Copy code
\vspace{1cm} % Adds vertical space
CSS (for HTML):
You can define custom CSS to adjust margins:

css
Copy code
.plot-container {
  margin-top: 20px;
  margin-bottom: 20px;
}
Then, assign the class to your plot.

5. Control Placement in the Document
If you're working with PDFs, you can use fig-pos to control placement on the page. For example, use h to place the plot exactly where it appears in the document source.

yaml
Copy code
#| fig-pos: h  # Use here placement for PDFs
Other options:

t: Place the figure at the top of the page.
b: Place the figure at the bottom of the page.
p: Place the figure on a separate page for floats.
6. Wrap the Plot with Text
For inline placement (like text wrapping), you can use a div or CSS. For example:

yaml
Copy code
::: {.figure .half-width}
#| fig-width: 4
#| fig-height: 3
Or, for Markdown:

markdown
Copy code
<img src="path-to-image.png" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;">
7. Use Quarto Layout Directives
If you're using Quarto, you can also explicitly specify column layouts:

yaml
Copy code
:::{.column-screen}
::: {.callout-note}
Your text here
:::
:::

:::{.column-screen}
```{r}
# Plot here
:::

yaml
Copy code

---

### **Summary: What Should You Do?**
To ensure your plot is well-positioned:
1. Use `fig-align: center` for alignment.
2. Control the size using `fig-width`, `fig-height`, or `out.width`.
3. Add `fig-pos` for PDF placement.
4. Experiment with column layouts for text and plot integration.
